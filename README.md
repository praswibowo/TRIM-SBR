# TRIM-SBR: TRIM-Smoothed Bootstrap Resampling

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/python/mypy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/python/mypy)

TRIM-Smoothed Bootstrap Resampling (TRIM-SBR) is a proposed method to reduce the overgeneralization problem that usually occurs when synthetic data is formed into a majority class region with evenly distributed synthetic data effects. Our method is based on pruning by looking for a particular minority area while maintaining the generality of the data so that it will find the minority data set while filtering out irrelevant data. The pruning results will produce a minority data seed that is used as a benchmark in duplicating data. To ensure the duplication of data is evenly distributed, the bootstrap resampling technique is used to create new data.

# Installation

The implementation is tested under python 3.7

* numpy (numpy>=1.13, <1.17)
* scikit-learn (>=0.19.0, <0.23)

## Clone the repo:

Clone this repository and run the TRIM-SBR.py file. Use the following commands to get a copy from GitHub and install all dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/praswibowo/TRIM-SBR.git
```

# Documentation

This project follows the [imbalanced-learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/) and [smote-variants](https://smote-variants.readthedocs.io/), the both of the documentation might also prove helpful.

## Example Usage
```
TRIM_sbr = MulticlassOversampling(TRIM_SBR(random_state=42))
TRIM_sbr_X_train, TRIM_sbr_y_train = TRIM_sbr.sample(X_train, y_train)

np.bincount(TRIM_sbr_y_train)
```
### Expected Output:

```
