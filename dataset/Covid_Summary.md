# Background

The SARS-Cov-2 spread rapidly from China to other countries with the World Health Organization (WHO) characterizing it as a pandemic on March 11. Recently, there has also been a sharp increase in the number of cases in developing countries, but due to a limited availability of tests the real extent of the spread is still unknown, which may lead to dire consequences in terms of adequate clinical care and the epidemiological knowledge needed to guide public health measures.

The exponential increase in the number of Covid-19 cases risks to overwhelm health systems with a demand for ICU beds far above the existing capacity.

In addition, the initial symptoms caused by Covid-19 overlap with the symptoms of flu-like illness caused by other respiratory viruses (including influenza), and coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and these other viruses has been reported, what could impact management decisions. Therefore, patients under investigation for Covid-19, sometimes have also requested a respiratory viral panel that can test for several other respiratory viruses at the same time (including influenza).

In the context of an overwhelmed health system with the possible limitation to perform tests for the detection of SARS-Cov-2, testing every case would be impractical and tests results could be delayed even if only a target subpopulation would be tested.

# Dataset
This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.

All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. All clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation. All dates have been omitted and the information on the patient's sex has been coded to assist the predictive models, however the mapping to the original value will not be provided.
